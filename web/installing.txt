1. Copy war or toppr folder to tomcat webapps directory
2. Install mysql and ppr database
    - create database ppr
    - use ppr
    - use mysql dump script (ppr.sql) to fill the ppr database
3. Create a context connection to the ppr database by changing the context.xml file in the tomcat/conf folder
    Change the <Context> ... </Context> by the following
<Context path="/DBTest" docBase="DBTest"
        debug="5" reloadable="true" crossContext="true">

    <!-- maxActive: Maximum number of dB connections in pool. Make sure you
         configure your mysqld max_connections large enough to handle
         all of your db connections. Set to 0 for no limit.
         -->

    <!-- maxIdle: Maximum number of idle dB connections to retain in pool.
         Set to -1 for no limit.  See also the DBCP documentation on this
         and the minEvictableIdleTimeMillis configuration parameter.
         -->

    <!-- maxWait: Maximum time to wait for a dB connection to become available
         in ms, in this example 10 seconds. An Exception is thrown if
         this timeout is exceeded.  Set to -1 to wait indefinitely.
         -->

    <!-- username and password: MySQL dB username and password for dB connections  -->

    <!-- driverClassName: Class name for the old mm.mysql JDBC driver is
         org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver - we recommend using Connector/J though.
         Class name for the official MySQL Connector/J driver is com.mysql.jdbc.Driver.
         -->

    <!-- url: The JDBC connection url for connecting to your MySQL dB.
         The autoReconnect=true argument to the url makes sure that the
         mm.mysql JDBC Driver will automatically reconnect if mysqld closed the
         connection.  mysqld by default closes idle connections after 8 hours.
         -->

4. Create a "guest" account with password "guest" on the ppr database
5. Create a "updater" account with password "updater,13*" on the ppr database
6. Give "select" privileges to the guest user
7. Give "select, delete, update, insert, ..." privileges to the updater user
8. Add a mysql driver jar file to tomcat/lib/
9. Set the correct path to the webapp (the toppr folder on the computer) in the info.properties file (tomcat/webapps/toppr/WEB-INF/classes)
10. Check the classpath in the updater.bat file (tomcat/webapps/toppr/WEB-INF/classes)
11. Set up a daily task to run updatar.bat (as an administrator)
12. Replace favicon.ico in the webapps/root/ folder by the new favicon.ico icon (found in the webapps/toppr/ folder)
13. Set the read/write privileges for the folder
